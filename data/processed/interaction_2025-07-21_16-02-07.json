    "fact": "The muzzle of a lion is like a fingerprint - no two lions have the same pattern of whiskers.",
    "instruction": "fvdfdv",
    "prompt": "Fvdfdv: The muzzle of a lion is like a fingerprint - no two lions have the same pattern of whiskers.",
    "response": "That statement is correct! The pattern of whisker spots (the small black dots where whiskers emerge) on a lion's muzzle is unique to each individual, much like a human fingerprint. Researchers use photographs of these whisker spot patterns, along with other features like scars and ear notches, to identify and track individual lions in the wild. So, the muzzle whisker pattern is indeed a reliable tool for lion identification."
