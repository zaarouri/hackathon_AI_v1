    "fact": "The muzzle of a lion is like a fingerprint - no two lions have the same pattern of whiskers.",
    "instruction": "fvdfdv",
    "prompt": "Fvdfdv: The muzzle of a lion is like a fingerprint - no two lions have the same pattern of whiskers.",
    "response": "Your statement is correct! The pattern of whisker spots (the small dark spots at the base of each whisker) on a lion's muzzle is unique to every individual, similar to how fingerprints are unique to each human. Researchers often use high-quality photographs of lions' faces to identify individuals based on these distinct whisker spot patterns. This method is non-invasive and helps scientists track and study lion populations over time. So, just like a fingerprint, a lion's muzzle pattern provides a reliable way to tell them apart!"
