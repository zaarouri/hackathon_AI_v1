    "fact": "The muzzle of a lion is like a fingerprint - no two lions have the same pattern of whiskers.",
    "instruction": "fvdfdv",
    "prompt": "Fvdfdv: The muzzle of a lion is like a fingerprint - no two lions have the same pattern of whiskers.",
    "response": "That's correct! Just like human fingerprints, the pattern of whisker spots (or \u201cwhisker rows\u201d) on a lion\u2019s muzzle is unique to each individual. Researchers use photographs of these muzzle patterns to identify and monitor individual lions in the wild. This method is a non-invasive and reliable way to track lion populations over time. So, the statement is accurate\u2014no two lions have exactly the same whisker pattern."
