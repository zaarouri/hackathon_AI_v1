    "fact": "The muzzle of a lion is like a fingerprint - no two lions have the same pattern of whiskers.",
    "instruction": "fvdfdv",
    "prompt": "Fvdfdv: The muzzle of a lion is like a fingerprint - no two lions have the same pattern of whiskers.",
    "response": "That statement is **true**! The pattern of whisker spots (the small dark spots where whiskers emerge on the muzzle) of a lion is unique to each individual, much like fingerprints in humans. Researchers and conservationists often use photographs of these whisker spot patterns to identify and monitor individual lions in the wild. So, \"The muzzle of a lion is like a fingerprint\u2014no two lions have the same pattern of whiskers\" is a correct and commonly cited fact."
