    "response": "That statement isn't accurate according to available data.\n\n**Golf courses do not cover 4% of North America.**\n\n**Here's a breakdown:**\n- North America (Canada, USA, Mexico) is roughly 24.7 million square kilometers (km\u00b2).\n- There are about 18,000 golf courses in the USA, 2,600 in Canada, and about 200 in Mexico\u2014estimated total: ~21,000.\n- Average area per golf course: 0.6 km\u00b2 (typical 18-hole, but many are less).\n\n**Calculation:**\n21,000 courses \u00d7 0.6 km\u00b2 = 12,600 km\u00b2.\n\n12,600 km\u00b2 / 24,700,000 km\u00b2 \u2248 0.05%\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nGolf courses cover roughly 0.05% of North America's land area\u2014far less than 4%.\n\n**Sources:**  \n- [How much land does golf take up? (USGA, Golf Digest)](https://www.golfdigest.com/story/how-much-land-is-devoted-to-golf-in-the-united-states)\n- [World Atlas/World Bank data for continent areas](https://www.worldatlas.com/continents/north-america.html)\n\nIf you have a specific source for the 4% figure, I'd be glad to help examine or clarify it!"
