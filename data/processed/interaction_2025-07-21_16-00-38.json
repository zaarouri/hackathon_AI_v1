    "fact": "The muzzle of a lion is like a fingerprint - no two lions have the same pattern of whiskers.",
    "instruction": "fvdfdv",
    "prompt": "Fvdfdv: The muzzle of a lion is like a fingerprint - no two lions have the same pattern of whiskers.",
    "response": "That's correct! The pattern of whisker spots, also known as \"vibrissae spots,\" on a lion\u2019s muzzle is unique to each individual\u2014much like a human fingerprint. Researchers and wildlife biologists use photographs of these patterns to identify and track individual lions in the wild for studies on population, movement, and behavior. So, your statement is accurate: no two lions have the same muzzle whisker pattern."
